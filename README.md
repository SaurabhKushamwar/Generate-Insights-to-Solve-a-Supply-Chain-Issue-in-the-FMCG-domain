# Generate Insights to Solve a Supply Chain Issue in the FMCG domain

## 🏢 Project Overview  
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India.  
The company currently operates in **Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara** and plans to expand to other Tier-1 cities within the next 2 years.  

However, the company is facing a major challenge:  
- A few key customers did **not renew their contracts** due to **poor service levels**.  
- Some essential products were **delivered late or incomplete**.  
- This created **bad customer experience** and risked future expansion.  

To solve this, the **Supply Chain Analytics Team** initiated a project to track:  
- ✅ On-Time Delivery (OT %)  
- ✅ In-Full Delivery (IF %)  
- ✅ On-Time In-Full (OTIF %)  

The goal is to monitor these metrics **daily at the customer/store level** and improve delivery service levels.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
> **Management wants to fix delivery issues before expansion.**  
> They asked the analytics team to **track service level metrics** and provide **insights on customer-level performance** to identify delays, incomplete deliveries, and improvement areas.

## 📈 Dashboard Insights  

1. **Overall Service Levels**  
   - OT %, IF %, and OTIF % are **below the target** in multiple cities.  
   - Performance gap of ~20–25% between best and worst customers.  

2. **Customer/Store-Level Insights**  
   - **Best performers:** Propel Mart, Rel Fresh, Expression Stores → consistently high on-time & full deliveries.  
   - **Worst performers:** Coolblue, Elite Mart, Lotus Mart → frequent delays and incomplete orders.  

3. **Trend Analysis**  
   - Delays spike in specific weeks, suggesting **seasonal or operational bottlenecks**.  
   - Early deliveries also contribute to service inconsistency.  

4. **Cluster Analysis**  
   - Customers grouped into **High Service / Low Service clusters**.  
   - Targeted actions can improve **low-service customers** instead of applying broad changes.  

---

## ✅ Key Recommendations  
- Standardize **logistics & inventory planning** across cities.  
- Conduct **root cause analysis** for worst-performing stores (Coolblue, Lotus, Elite).  
- Share **best practices** from top-performing customers across the network.  
- Implement **real-time monitoring** of OT, IF, and OTIF to proactively address issues.
